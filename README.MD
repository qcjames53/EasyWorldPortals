# Easy World Portals
###### Version 1.1

## Introduction
Easy World Portals is a Minecraft 1.20 datapack which smoothly mimics Valve-style world portals in Minecraft custom maps. Think the [Immersive Portals mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-portals-mod) but in very limited circumstances.

## Installing the datapack
Back up your world. This datapack can seriously destroy worlds if/when things hit the fan.

Copy the `portal` folder into your `datapacks` directory. After enabling, use your main datapack to call `function portal:tick` once every tick. Alternatively, uncomment `function __tick__() { tick(); }` in portal.jmc and recompile to run the pack standalone.
